# Python

> In python, there is not separate syntax for object instantiation

e.g. in C++/Java/JS
```
a = function(); # plain function
t = new Thing(); # instantiation
```

whereas in Python,

```
t = getthing() # everything
```

In C++/Java/JavaScript , you can't just directly return a class.
You have design Patterns 

* Returning another class -> Factory Method, Abstract Factory

* Always return the same instance -> Singleton
